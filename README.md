Brainhack Princeton 2020 is a satellite event for [Brainhack Global 2020](https://brainhack.org/global2020/) taking place December 9th-11th at Princeton University. Brainhack is 3-day collaborative hackathon focused on best practices in open neuroscience, including community, infrastructure, and software development. Brainhacks are a great opportunity to discover new tools, push the boundaries of open science, and meet collaborators building tomorrow's neuroscience. Our goal is to create a space where anyone can learn and contribute, even if this is your first hackathon.
